# Lintflix

A shell utility to commit the staged changes using a movie or tv-show inspired message.  

## Why?

I tend to make mistakes against the style guide so I create linting commits on a regular base. I don't like boring messages so I thought it would be fun to add movie & tv-show inspired messages, slightly adjusted to have the word "lint" somewhere.

Inspired by https://github.com/fowbi/lint-along
